\section{Method overview}
The experimental part of this thesis is centred around iris obfuscation. Specifically, I propose and evaluate a large number of possible iris obfuscation methods. The experimental design and choice of obfuscation methods is based on the signal-processing foundation presented.

The work is comprised of two experiments. The split design is a result the time complexity of evaluating iris recognition. Due to the high accuracies involved, a large number of comparisons are necessary to achieve ...
