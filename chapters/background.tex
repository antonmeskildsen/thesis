\chapter{Eye information processes}
This chapter provides an overview of an \gls{eye-process}. I define an eye information process as any process that uses a human eye as its input and has the aim of extracting some property of interest from it. The term thus covers both systems that analyse eye movement, i.e. eye-tracking, and eye appearance, e.g. iris recognition, retinal imagery, etc. 

The first section provides an overview of the anatomy of human eyes. It serves as a reference for easily understanding how eye information processes uses the anatomy for their operation as well as what the physical limitations are. 

Next, the foundations of modern eye-tracking systems will be presented. The goal is to provide the reader with a birds-eye view of the field and its methods.

The final section focuses on sensitive information. Both appearance-based extraction techniques such as iris recognition and gaze-based techniques such as attention-analysis will be presented. 


\section{Anatomy}
Our eyes are an essential part of the human existence. What is so special about the eyes is that they are not just sensory apparatuses for enabling us to register many properties of the physical world around us but also reveal a wealth of information about their owner's current physical and mental state. From a social perspective, eye movements communicate where their owner are looking which typically corresponds with their focus of attention. Additionally, eyes are clearly used socially as indicators of well-being as well as social interaction, i.e. by looking into the eyes of other people. It is likely no coincidence that the eyes have often mythologically been described as doorways to the soul or in some other way been seen as a logical end-point of our minds. To see is often analogous to understand or realise.

Figure (REF) shows an overview of a right eye. It is shaped approximately like a sphere with a bulge where the \emph{cornea} is places. The most interesting areas from the perspective of eye information processes, are the retina and the frontal lens complex. 

The \emph{retina} is a tissue covering the inside of the eye. It is composed of light sensitive neurons called photoreceptors, which react to either a wide (rods) or narrow (cones) band of light bandwidths. The rods are used for black/white vision, typically in low-light conditions due to their much higher sensitivity than cones. Cones are primarily used for colour vision as there are three types which each respond to a specific band of wavelengths. Cones have a much higher concentration around a small area on the retina called the \emph{fovea}. This area enables high visual acuity and is therefore generally considered the primary place of attention. In fact, it is well-known that, in spite of the rapid drop-off in photoreceptor density outside the fovea, the human brain succeeds in combining visual information from many individual fixations to produce what seems like high-resolution visual perception.

    \label{fig:my_label}
\end{figure}

The fovea is very important for determining gaze direction or point-of-regard since it determines what is known as the \emph{visual} axis which intersects the lens centre and fovea. This visual axis typically varies slightly (about 5 degrees) from the \emph{optical axis} which intersects the cornea, pupil, and lens. This variation is different from person to person which has to be corrected by an eye-tracker. Typical modern eye-trackers have gaze direction errors of about $0.5^\circ-1.5^\circ$ which is much lower than the $\pm 5^\circ$ of the visual axis.

The frontal lens complex contains the components that allow light to enter the eye in a controlled manner. The lens system is composed of the static \emph{cornea} which accounts for a majority of the eye's optical power and the \emph{lens} which is adjusted by muscles called \emph{ciliary bodies} located behind the iris. The \emph{iris} is composed of muscles that control the size of the circular opening in its middle known as the \emph{pupil}. This allows the eye to adjust the amount of light entering the eye. 

\subsection{Eye movements}
Eye movements are formed of both conscious, semiconscious, and unconscious actions. This has led to great interest in studying these movements for various purposes, including behavioural studies as well as ...

There are five basic categories of eye movements: saccades, vergence movements, smooth pursuits, vestibular, and physiological nystagmus \parencite[39]{methodology}. Saccades are further subdivided into macro- and micro-saccades. Macro-saccades are the typical jerky movements we perform when moving from fixation to fixation. Micro-saccades are involuntary movements of $0.03-2$ degrees. The purpose of micro-saccades is to change the light-stimulus on the retina, since continuous stimulus of photoreceptors results in decreasing activation strength over time \parencite[44]{methodology}. Smooth pursuits are a mode of movement where the eye follows a fixation point on a moving object. Vergence movements are relative movements of the left and right eye to ensure vergence of the visual axes at the point of fixation \parencite{methodology}.


\section{Eye-tracking}
\Gls{eye-tracking} covers the processes of detecting the location and movements of eyes and estimating \gls{gaze}. Gaze is defined as either a specific \acrfull{por} or as a \emph{direction}. Today, this is done exclusively through image based techniques (REF) but intrusive methods, typically using some form of special contact lens in combination with a sensor, also exist (REF).

\subsection{Why}
To understand \gls{eye-tracking}, we first need to understand the purposes for which it was made. 

In terms of research, \gls{eye-tracking} has traditionally been of interest in psychology (REfs) and physiology (REFS) studies due to the close connection between gaze and attention and the prominent use of eyes in humans everyday lives. A typical application is the study of visual attention, i.e. where a person is looking in a specific situation over time. Examples include studies of driver behaviour (REF), shopping behaviour (REF), analysis of reading ability and how reading works (REF), how the eyes are used in elite sports and whether analysis may be used for athletic improvements (REFS), and many more. In the medical industry, eye-tracking has been used as a tool in diagnosis of both psychological and physical conditions (REF). 

Most importantly for this thesis however, are applications in \acrfull{hci} which is a term that covers technologies or systems that act as interfaces between humans and computers (REF). The rapid decrease in part costs has made consumer-level and large-scale medical \acrlong{hci} feasible. Major corporations investing in \acrfull{vr} technologies including NVidia and Facebook, have started major research efforts towards enabling low-cost and precise eye-tracking built into \acrshort{vr}-headsets (REF). In the medical industry, technologies such as tablets have already been deployed on large scales to enrich the communication abilities of people suffering from various diseases (REF). Eye-tracking technologies that are easier to use and simpler to set up are actively being researched as well (REF). 

\subsection{How it works}
All eye-tracking systems are composed of some common elements. FIGREF shows a possible component schematic of such a generalised system. At the most abstract level - an eye tracker works by capturing images of one or both of the subject's eyes and uses a number of different techniques to track the eyes themselves and to predict gaze. Because the use cases vary widely, a number of important classifications exist based on the hardware setup as well as the analysis methods employed.

The capturing setup is primarily determined by the relative mounting position of the eye-facing camera relative to the subject (REF). In \gls{head-mounted} \gls{eye-tracking},  the eye-facing camera is fixed relative to the head of the subject and hence translational movements of the eye are kept to a minimum. The alternative is remote\todo{glossary} \gls{eye-tracking} where the camera is not fixed to the head and therefore allows more degrees of movement (REF). Head-mounted eye-trackers may typically be augmented by a \gls{scene-camera} which points directly away from their head and can thus be used to determine what they are looking at a given point in time. \Gls{head-mounted} \gls{eye-tracker}s are often used when high-precision detection or gaze estimation is needed but comes at the cost of being less convenient to set up than a remote camera (REF). Remote setups may provide high-precision eye-tracking if the head is fixed using a chin-rest or similar. The precision gained by fixing the relative position of eye and camera most stems mainly from the much higher utilisation of the image resolution as the eye can fill the entire image. Eye-tracking precision is generally affected by the environment, which is why controlled environments are generally preferred if possible. In many cases however, such as attention analysis, the environment cannot be controlled .... \todo{Example images and hardware setups!}

Eye-tracking systems cover a large range of use cases that require the detection of different properties. \Gls{gaze} is the most widely used end-product which may itself be used in secondary analyses of other personal properties (SECTION EYEINFO). Other important products include the iris and sclera textures which may be used for personal identification (REF) and the size of the pupil as it changes in response to external stimuli (REF). \Gls{gaze} is also typically used for eye movement analysis which produces an event-based overview of what kind of movements occur at given points in time (REFS). The different end-products have different requirements, but they all share the fundamental concept of being properties of interest that should be extracted from the source eye images. This generalisation idea is built upon in later sections (SECREF) to provide a theoretical model for eye-tracking that is useful for analysing privacy....

The property detection methods, of which there may be many or few in a given eye-tracking system, are typically classified as either appearance-based or feature-based. However, because of how modern systems including convolutional neural network (CNN) based ones makes the line seem less clear-cut, I redefine the two classes as holistic and local approaches after the same terms used in (dan REF). Figure (REF) shows the classification scheme. Holistic approaches consider the eye in its entirety, either by methods such as template matching (REF), or machine learning models such as CNNs mapping images directly to gaze. Local approaches instead consider specific eye elements or image features which are then combined. 

Eye-trackers may mix these methods. For example, CNNs which are inherently appearance-based have been shown to be extremely accurate at predicting the pupil centre which is then used in a two-dimensional gaze estimation model whic

%appearance-based and feature-based methods. The former covers methods that use the source image appearance to predict an output property

%Appearance-based methods use the image appearance itself to determine some property, e.g. eye position. This can be done either by template matching (REF), filter responses, or, more widespread today, using neural networks (REFS). 

%Feature-based 
%Shape-based models cover methods that try to fit a prior eye shape model to a single or several features in the image. Feature-based approaches aim at detecting non-typical features such as corneal reflections of LED lights or eye corners.


%Gaze estimation models are generally divided into two-dimensional models, three-dimensional models, and appearance-based models. The former two use detected eye features for gaze estimation and are therefore often collectively referred to as feature-based methods (REF dan). This is not to be confused with the feature-based paradigm itself although the two are often used together.

%The image based methods, which are the sole focus in this thesis, are typically broken down into components as shown in (FIGREF). Generally, the steps of eye detection and gaze estimation are separate, but in the case of \emph{appearance-based} gaze estimation, the image is mapped directly to gaze and thus skips the detection step. This approach is dominated by deep neural networks (REFS) and is most prominent in settings 



%Depending on the approach used, eye detection and gaze estimation may be individual steps or combined. 

%Knowing where people are looking is useful both for studying human behaviour and providing interactive technologies. 

%Eye-tracking is a scientific field that cover many different disciplines from computer science and engineering to psychology and biology. These can be divided into the research in eye-tracking technology and research enabled by eye-tracking technology. This section focuses on the former. It gives a short introduction to the eye-tracking technologies available today, how they work, and where they are used.
