\chapter{Analysis of iris obfuscation: Generalising eye information processes for privacy studies in eye tracking}\label{ch:article}

\section*{Overview for the thesis}

\emph{
The experimental part of this thesis is largely contained in the following article, which proposes and evaluates a large number of possible iris obfuscation methods. Iris obfuscation is concerned only with the selective degradation of iris patterns in eye-tracking. The term is first used in \cite{BRENDAN_BLUR} where a simple low-pass filter model is presented using either optics or convolution but is expanded in the article to cover more general cases using the EIP model terminology. }

\emph{The article presents a short overview of some of the same points made in this thesis. Afterwards, the obfuscation methods are introduced and tested in two different experiments to first determine appropriate method parameters and subsequently evaluate the actual performance. It presents both the EIP model and large-scale evaluation as contributions bringing the field towards a better base for understanding iris obfuscation methods, difficulties, and limitations. Some of the presented methods outperform existing ones by a large margin. The methods presented here and in the thesis have been defined as a result of this analysis.}

\emph{To tie the article's narrative into the thesis, the next chapters presents additional technical details and further analysis and discussion of the results.}
